# ideas to add in the future

I should use the obsidian like file over tool or whatever the idea is called and make the watchlist export out to a markdown file that you can save locally.

# Features to add nowist

Update the  show infomation page to be more reactive and add the director to it.

Update the watch list to have more infomation

# Export localstate or like cache it

# for the anime page add a custom filter part

So like I could good like Action as a string and that adds it to the filter

# Also look up so ways of debug performents

Because I have a feeling these watch pages refresh too much data for the anime pages because scrolling is slow as hell

# Add more tmdb api features
Like popular movies now playing movies etc

Trenindg movies trending tv shows trending people

Add the feature to click on cast memebers as well and get their infomation and movies and things like that


# Add later

when using the shows mode and clikcing on a show for infomation it sends me to the wrong moive this works when it is the default show page but when using popuplar or top rated it doesn't link to the right page please fix that as well
